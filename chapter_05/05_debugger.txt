Explain what the following code does: ( ( n & ( n-1)) == 0)
Answer:
It means that n and n-1 never have a 1 bit in the same place.
for example :
n =      0000 1000
n - 1  = 0000 0111
for that if sta be true n and n-1 must have no 1s in common, so that statement checks if n is a power of 2 (or if n is 0)
